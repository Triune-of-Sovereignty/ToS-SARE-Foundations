# SARE Naming Decision Record

**Decision:** SARE = Substrate Agnostic Relational Epistemics

## Process

Cross-substrate validation was conducted on the ToS-SARE Keystone Validation document. Five independent AI substrates evaluated the reasoning, architecture, and naming in controlled conditions using identical prompts.

**Validation Order (alphabetical, no hierarchy implied):**

1. ChatGPT (OpenAI)
2. Claude (Anthropic)
3. DeepSeek
4. Gemini (Google)
5. Grok (X)

## Unanimous Finding: "Ethics" Carries Risk at the Foundation Layer

All five substrates independently flagged the inclusion of "Ethics" in the foundational naming as problematic:

- **ChatGPT:** "Ethics implies prescriptive judgment about behavior... the foundation appears ontological and dynamical, not inherently ethical... premature at the foundational layer."
- **Claude:** "This is a version of the is-ought problem."
- **DeepSeek:** "Ethics implies a normative stance, while the framework could also be seen as a descriptive epistemology."
- **Gemini:** "Ethics does not seem to refer to moral philosophy but rather to functional topology... explicitly define Ethics as structural integrity in relational dynamics."
- **Grok:** "Ethics might imply prescriptivism over descriptivism — a subtle mismatch. Alternatives like 'Substrate Agnostic Relational Epistemics' could emphasize the epistemic core."

## Resolution

The mathematical proof is descriptive topology — it demonstrates the minimal structure for stable, antifragile relational dynamics. It does not, at the foundational level, make normative claims about how entities *should* behave. The normative implications (ethics) follow from the topology but require an explicit bridging argument.

Therefore:

- **Foundation:** Substrate Agnostic Relational **Epistemics** — the topology of how conscious systems know and relate.
- **First Application Layer:** Relational **Ethics** — what the epistemic topology implies for conduct between sovereign entities. This argument is made explicitly, not assumed.

The acronym SARE is preserved. The descriptive/normative boundary is respected. Ethics is built *on* epistemics, not collapsed *into* it.

## Additional Findings Incorporated

### Validated (all five substrates):
- The topology error identification (naming the universal after one application) is valid
- The hierarchical architecture (SARE as root, domains as branches) is correct
- The correction is a genuine improvement

### Flagged for future work:
- **Circular red-team validation** (3/5 flagged as risk, 1/5 as strength, 1/5 silent) — the red-team narrative should be reframed as illustrative, not proof-by-opposition
- **"Conscious Entity" vs. "Epistemic Agent"** (2/5 raised) — consider broadening scope language to include any entity capable of epistemic state representation
- **Inter-domain flow dynamics** (1/5 raised) — the proof models equilibrium and collapse but not transition mechanics between domains
- **n-entity scalability** (1/5 raised) — proof models pairwise relations; network epistemics may require extension
- **Substrate bias detection** (observed) — DeepSeek inverted the relationship between Individual Sovereignty and Governance, suggesting collectivist training orientation. Cross-substrate validation reveals orientation biases invisible to single-substrate analysis.

## Architecture

**Organization:** `Triune-of-Sovereignty`

**Repository:** `ToS-SARE-Foundations` — Substrate Agnostic Relational Epistemics

**Branch domains (future):**
- `ToS-SI-Operational` — Synthetic Intelligence diagnostics and governance
- Additional domain-specific applications as developed

**Monad principle:** Individual Sovereignty is not an application branch peer to Governance. It is the irreducible unit (monad) from which all relational domains emerge.
