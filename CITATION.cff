abstract: >-
  The Triune of Sovereignty is a formal mathematical framework
  demonstrating that three epistemic domains — Known, Unknown,
  and Unknowable — constitute the minimal necessary structure
  for stable, antifragile relationships between knowing systems.
  SARE (Substrate Agnostic Relational Epistemics) describes the
  topology of how any knowing system relates to reality and to
  other knowing systems, independent of substrate. Validated
  across five independent AI substrates through adversarial
  evaluation. The original formal proof was unanimously rejected.
  The structural architecture held.
