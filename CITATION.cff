abstract: >-
  A formal mathematical framework demonstrating that three epistemic domains —
  the Known, the Unknown, and the Unknowable — constitute the minimal necessary
  structure for stable, antifragile relationships between knowing systems.
  Validated across five independent AI substrates through three rounds of
  cross-substrate evaluation. The original formal proof was unanimously rejected.
  The structural architecture held. What was discovered through the validation
  process was stronger than what was originally claimed.
