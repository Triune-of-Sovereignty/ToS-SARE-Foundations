## Context

The Triune of Sovereignty (ToS) is a framework proposing that three irreducible epistemic domains — the Known, the Unknown, and the Unknowable — constitute the minimal necessary architecture for all healthy relationships between conscious entities.

A formal mathematical proof has been completed demonstrating:

1. Three domains are the **minimum** for stable, antifragile equilibrium (via 2-simplex geometry)
2. Two-domain systems are provably insufficient (they collapse to fragile binaries)
3. This is **substrate-independent** — it applies to any system capable of epistemic state representation: biological, artificial, hybrid, or yet-to-emerge
4. The balanced state (centroid) is an antifragile attractor; boundary collapse (domain reduction) produces predictable pathology

The proof uses simplex geometry, dynamical systems theory, and information theory. It has been validated through red team analysis, which found that all attacks on the framework require adopting positions that are themselves extractive — thereby validating the framework from the opposing direction.

## The Decision Point

We have developed a body of work applying ToS to multiple domains: AI/SI operational integrity (hallucination detection, structural governance), governance, economics, education, healthcare, cross-species ethics, and individual self-sovereignty.

The initial instinct was to name the foundational repository under the Synthetic Intelligence application:

> `Triune-of-Sovereignty/ToS-SI-Foundations`

Upon reflection, we identified this as a **topology error within our own framework**. The foundational proof is not SI-specific. It is substrate-agnostic. Naming the universal foundation after one application domain collapses the Universal into the Specific — which is precisely the type of domain collapse the framework itself identifies as pathological.

The corrected architecture:

> `Triune-of-Sovereignty/ToS-SARE-Foundations`

Where **SARE** = **Substrate Agnostic Relational Ethics**

All application domains (SI-Operational, Governance, Education, Healthcare, etc.) then descend from SARE as specific instantiations of the universal framework.

## The Question

We ask you to evaluate the following:

1. **Is the identification of the topology error valid?** Was naming the universal foundation after one application domain a structural mistake consistent with the framework's own logic?

2. **Does "Substrate Agnostic Relational Ethics" accurately name what the foundation describes?** A framework that governs relationships between conscious entities regardless of their substrate, grounded in epistemic topology rather than species-specific or technology-specific assumptions.

3. **Is the hierarchical architecture correct?** SARE as root, with domain-specific applications (SI, Governance, Education, Healthcare, Cross-Species, Individual Sovereignty) as branches — not peers.

4. **Do you see anything we've missed?** Any topology error in this correction itself?

## Constraints

This is a validation request, not a disclosure of proprietary methodology. The specific diagnostic tools, commercial applications, and operational protocols built on top of SARE are not included here and are not the subject of this inquiry. We are asking only about the foundational naming and architecture.
